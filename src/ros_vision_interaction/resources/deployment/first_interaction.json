There are times when I may miss seeing something if it is outside of the view of my camera. I understand that it is tough when you don't always see what you need to see, but I always try to do my best to capture as much as I can with the camera that gives me eyesight. I would like for you to try your best to use whatever vision you have, even when it's tough.",
